## Decisions:

* Clean architecture selected for base structure of project. the main parts of this structure include Data, Domain and Presentation layers.
* The MVVM architecture selected for presentation layer and Combine framework used for view binding (connecting view to view model).
* No UI test wroted for the project because of time restriction. However test coverage of the project is about 80%.
* If I had more time, I would write some UI tests for project.
